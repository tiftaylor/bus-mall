# Lab 11 | Bus Mall Data Collection
**Author:** Tif Taylor | **Class:** Code Fellows 201 | **Date:** July 2020

**About:**
The assignment has a client wanting to make Bus Mall shopping catalogues but wants to know which products are most likely to sell and therefore wants to collect data via an app. We're asked to show 3 random products at a time to let the user vote on one of the products up to 25 votes, and then show the results of what products were clicked on the most.
