# Lab 11 | Bus Mall Data Collection
**Author:** Tif Taylor | **Class:** Code Fellows 201 | **Date:** July 2020

**About:**
The assignment has a client wanting to make Bus Mall shopping catalogues but wants to know which products are most likely to sell and therefore wants to collect data via an app. We're asked to show 3 random products at a time to let the user vote on one of the products up to 25 votes, and then show the results of what products were clicked on the most. 

**Resources:**
- After a while of googling, I decided to go with [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18806210/generating-non-repeating-random-numbers-in-js/18806417#18806417) for what approach to take on making sure my random index didn't duplicate itself when generating new product images
- To remind myself how to add on bullet points to `li` elements when using a reset CSS file, I used the property and value set fround at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_list.asp)
- For the chart we're using documentation from [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)
- To figure out how to repeat the color array for my graph for all products, I used this [StackOverflow Page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59691890/chart-js-repeating-colors)
- Used this [StackOverlow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3955229/remove-all-child-elements-of-a-dom-node-in-javascript) to prevent my hmtl result list from duplicating after refresh
- This was the most helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc&feature=youtu.be) I found when trying to understand flexbox.
- When trying to prevent the images from getting overlapped by the result column [StackFlow Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28029736/how-to-prevent-a-flex-item-from-shrinking-smaller-than-its-content)
